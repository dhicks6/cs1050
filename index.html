    <h1>Which political party thinks president trump was handeling the Covid 19 response the best</h1>
    <img src="logo.png">
    <p>Democrats average approval rating from the data set was 21.1023%.</p>
    <p>Democrats average dissapproval rating from the data set was 75.6880%.</p>
    <p>Republicans average approval rating from the data set was 76.2964%.</p>
    <p>Republicans average dissapproval rating from the data set was 20.4801%.</p>
    <p>From the data we can see that democrate and republicans mirrored each other in how they felt the president handeled his covid 19 response.</p>
    <p>With the averages we can say that republicans thought the president handled the reponse the best.</p>
    
    <p>For this project I used data from https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/ which was one of the linked sources in the project home page.</p>
    <p>The data was collected over a 6 month period in 2020. Many different sources are listed in the data.</p>
    <p>To find the averages of the data I used a local mysql database, and loaded the provided .csv file into it. I then ran commands like</p>
    <p>SELECT AVG(approve) FROM polls.covid_approval_polls WHERE party="d"; this command does is takes the approval percent from all polls</p>
    <p>where democrats were the only ones polled. I then did the same for the democrat dissapproval rate, and then for republicans as well.</p>

    <p>I have used Excel to make my graphs. They show the mirroring of how each party felt about the issue. At the end you will notice a sharp change.</p>
    <p>This section of the data is where the question was asked about Presidents Bidens response when he was still campaigning. I thought it was interesting</p>
    <p>that the democrats were more harsh on the oposing candidate than the republicans were. There may be more questions, and data to change this in the future</p>
